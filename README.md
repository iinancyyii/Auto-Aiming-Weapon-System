# Auto-Aiming-Weapon-System
<hr>

It is a automated gun target and firing system if found an object within a range of sensors. The project is primarily based on IR Sensors, The Project is required because till today, the border is protected by Iron Spike wires, and a watch tower containing a person continuously flashing the light over the border area day and night. Those persons are fully responsible for any intrusion. This project will not fully remove the responsibility from their soldiers, but minimize the responsibility and human mistakes on the border. 

**The hardware configurations required for this project were:**
> - Arduino (Atmega 32)
> - IR Sensor
> - Motor
> - Double Relay
> - LEDs
> - Breadboard
